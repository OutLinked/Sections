## Placement

*In what order to arrange sections.*

<br>

-   The most important part of a good developer  
    facing offer is to place the **Requirements** first.
    
    *If you are unqualified there is no point*  
    *in continue reading the offer after all.*

    <br>
    
    **Requirements**  ›  **Additional**  ›  **Technologies**  ›  **Services**  ›  **Scope**
    
    <br>
    
-   Place the **Salary** & **Benefits** next so the developer can  
    evaluate if they consider the off being worth their time.

    <br>
    
-   Next describe the **Tasks**, they are usually a given not very  
    important as the developer already has a picture of the  
    situation from the previously placed technical sections.

    <br>
    
-   At the very end place information about the **Company**,  <br>
    while you may intent to present it to candidates, there  
    usually is no need for it.

    *Either a candidate knows the company and is*  
    *taking the offer deliberately or they choose a*  
    *company based on the presented job.*
    
    *Thus placing company related information*  
    *first is either redundant or just in the way.*
